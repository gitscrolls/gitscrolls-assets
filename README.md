# 🖼️ GITSCROLLS-ASSETS

_A reliquary of symbols, sigils, and sacred layers._

This repository houses the visual artifacts of the GitScrolls mythos:  
every Aspect of Tux, every banner, every mosaic, every whisper of PNG prophecy.

What was once clutter in the sacred scrolls now finds breath and brilliance here.

## 🌠 Purpose

To decouple lore from form.  
To store icons with reverence.  
To let pixels sing without weighing down the teaching.

These assets are used across:
- [`gitscrolls`](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls) — The sacred text
- [`gitscrolls-website`](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls-website) — The temple for pilgrims
- [`gitscrolls-community`](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls-community) — The shared hearth

## 💡 Usage

Most images can be linked directly via GitHub raw URLs or served through your web layer.  

For larger binaries, consider initializing Git LFS:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.png"
